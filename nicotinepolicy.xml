Conventional waterpipes may expose users to lower levels of harmful substances than cigarettes. Different charcoals or a heating device can reduce exposure. Electronic waterpipes showed significant reductions in toxicants. Findings align with existing literature, suggesting lower exposure with waterpipes compared to cigarettes. Emissions analysis corrects misconceptions about waterpipe nicotine content. Real-world use patterns impact exposure. Overall, exposure to harmful substances is lower with waterpipes and electronic devices compared to cigarettes. Innovative heating methods can further reduce toxicant exposure in waterpipes. Study limitations include standardized testing and assumptions on consumption patterns. In conclusion, waterpipes emit fewer toxins than cigarettes, with potential for decreased exposure through modifications.

The law aims to promote a healthy lifestyle, especially among youth, by reinforcing regulations on tobacco and nicotine-related items. It includes penalties for illegal activities and exempts individuals who report violations. Similar laws have been enacted in neighboring countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The legislation aligns with efforts to protect public health, the national gene pool, and the environment from harmful tobacco products. The law was proposed in January 2024 and passed in April.

Chinese-made vapes, like many illicit products, are now subject to a 170% tariff due to Trump's trade war. The changing landscape may impact prices and affect consumer behavior. Despite health concerns, vapes can help smokers transition away from cigarettes. Legal vape options face competition from illegal counterparts with more variety and nicotine content. The tariffs could potentially benefit legal vape companies and deter underage vaping, despite drawbacks. Ultimately, the tariffs may offer a solution to the unregulated vaping market.

TPA criticized WHO for ignoring harm reduction benefits and advocating prohibition policies, leading to a growing black market for tobacco harm reduction products. The organization's reluctance to adapt to modern science and real-world solutions jeopardizes its credibility. TPA aims to hold WHO accountable through their Good COP/Bad COP campaign, urging the organization to prioritize public health over outdated policies. The webinar highlighted the urgent need for WHO reform and recognition of safer alternatives like vaping and heated tobacco products.

The research indicates that implementing WHO's recommended 75% tax could have potentially saved over 280,000 children's lives. The study analyzed data from 94 countries between 2008-2020, showing how increased cigarette taxes can improve child survival across all socioeconomic groups. Lead author Olivia Bannon emphasizes the importance of raising cigarette taxes to protect children's health, particularly in vulnerable populations. The study highlights the need to combat tobacco industry interference to implement effective tobacco control policies globally.

Spain plans to ban vape flavors, except tobacco, and limit nicotine pouches to 0.99mg. The decree faces scrutiny for affecting market competition. Health Ministry claims flavors attract non-smokers. Manufacturers have 10 months to comply with new regulations. High court overturns Barcelona beach vaping ban, citing lack of power. Spain's excise duty on smoke-free products may impact lower-income groups. Concerns arise that strict regulations could reverse declining smoking rates.

They argue that flavours help smokers switch to safer options and caution against unintended consequences seen in Denmark. The ban risks driving former smokers back to cigarettes and the black market. Data shows adult vapers prefer flavoured products. Experts recommend science-based regulations that protect public health while supporting harm reduction. In Denmark, a ban on vape flavours unintentionally increased youth use and spurred illegal sales. Critics warn against over-regulation and point to Sweden's harm reduction success. Research confirms flavoured vapes aid smoking cessation. Advocates call for evidence-based policies to safeguard gains in public health.

This emerging trend raises concerns, mirroring the past rise of flavored e-cigarettes. The FDA's decision to allow marketing of Zyn pouches to adults is controversial, given their popularity among teens. Research shows a demographic pattern favoring white males in rural areas. Both nicotine pouch and e-cigarette use increased in 2024, with more teens engaging in dual use. Long-term health effects are uncertain, but addiction risks persist. Preventative measures and regulation are crucial to address this public health issue. Tracking trends and evaluating policies are essential for targeted prevention strategies.

This comes as PMI pushes to end cigarette sales. With Robert F. Kennedy Jr. now leading the Department of Health and Human Services, there may be major changes in tobacco regulation. Meanwhile, PMI's nicotine pouch brand Zyn is seeing rapid growth in the U.S., with shipments in the Americas up nearly 54% in Q1 2025. Smoke-free products now make up 42% of PMI's revenue, compared to 25% a year ago. Although PMI still earns most of its revenue from smokers, that could soon shift due to Zyn’s rising popularity.
