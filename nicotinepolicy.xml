Under the draft law, flavours like biscuit, chocolate, watermelon, fruit and even whiskey, which are particularly popular among both teenagers and adults, would be pulled off the market, with only tobacco and mint flavours spared. The e-cigarette sector in Greece employs about 10,000 people, including 2,000 specialized retailers.

A recent study at Massachusetts General Hospital found that young e-cigarette users who took varenicline with counseling were more successful in quitting vaping compared to those on a placebo. The research, authored by Eden Evins, highlights the effectiveness of this approach for controlling nicotine cravings among youth. This could lead to a significant shift in how healthcare providers address nicotine addiction in young people, as varenicline has shown promise as a treatment option.

Yet, concerns shift to rising e-cigarette use, despite many using them to quit smoking. Misinformation surrounds tobacco harm reduction products, with the CDC downplaying e-cigarettes' harm reduction potential. Policies backed by Bloomberg are pushed, despite their misleading labeling of e-cigarettes as tobacco products. E-cigarettes are proven to be significantly less harmful than cigarettes.

Despite economic growth, per capita income remains low. The country recently banned nicotine vapes, potentially due to protecting the government-owned tobacco industry and influenced by misinformation. The ban could lead to thriving illicit markets, while ignoring evidence that vaping bans may increase smoking rates. Contrary to facts, various organizations, including Bloomberg Philanthropies and the WHO, support the ban. The UKâ€™s success with reducing smoking using alternative nicotine products is overlooked. Proponents argue for safer options, highlighting that bans may harm public health. (Published on April 23, 2025byfiltermag.org)</description></item></channel></rss>
