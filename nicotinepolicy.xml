The law requires products to meet specific criteria and be listed in the directory by Sept. 1, 2025. It exempts open-system devices with replaceable batteries but not products with built-in batteries. Violators face penalties, and packaging restrictions target child-appealing designs. Arkansas restricts personal possession and importation of unregistered products. This law is only the second in the U.S. to ban personal possession of vaping products. More states are introducing PMTA registry bills in 2025, following Mississippi's lead. Consumer advocacy groups are mobilizing against these bills across the country.

ZYN's strategy excludes influencers and celebrities, ensuring age-appropriate marketing. Although some critics suggest youth targeting through flavors and colors, ZYN's subdued branding defies this narrative. Grassroots enthusiasm and organic content differentiate ZYN's marketing approach, diverging from typical influencer strategies. Despite stringent age-gating measures and limited ad platforms, skepticism persists. The tension reflects broader societal mistrust and bias. ZYN's efforts to prevent underage use receive scrutiny from tobacco control, hinting at underlying motives in the anti-smoking agenda.

However, flavors like menthol can increase usage frequency, especially among young people. Research shows that sweet flavors attract youth to vaping, contributing to nicotine dependence. Efforts have been made to regulate vaping products due to health concerns and their appeal to teens. The FDA oversees restrictions on sales and bans flavored products. Despite regulations, flavored e-cigarettes remain popular among teens. Manufacturers must consider the appeal of their products in addressing addiction issues and promoting public health.
