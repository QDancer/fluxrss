The goal is to help the state decide whether to issue more adult-use marijuana business licenses. All firms agree that Missouri’s recreational cannabis market, launched in 2022, has been a success. Experts say the success is largely due to the state issuing only the minimum number of licenses allowed by its constitution.

Sweden challenges this move, citing EU laws. Precedents like the Cassis de Dijon case and the German Beer Purity Law indicate that such restrictions may violate EU trade laws. Spain's proposal lacks scientific basis, leaning towards de facto bans. The arbitrary limit may face legal obstacles based on past rulings, emphasizing EU principles on free trade. The EU must intervene to ensure fair market access and support safer alternatives for smokers in Spain.

Why Nicotine?</title><link>https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/nicotine-patch-for-alzheimers-could-nicotine-help-you-remember</link><description>For decades, nicotine has been viewed primarily as a harmful and addictive substance — the main reason people become hooked on cigarettes and other tobacco products. Humans have used tobacco for over 12,000 years, whether by smoking, chewing, or sniffing it. In more recent years, pharmaceutical companies have developed nicotine patches, gums, and lozenges to help people quit smoking — all available without a prescription. However, new research is beginning to challenge this one-sided view. Scientists are now exploring whether nicotine might also offer potential therapeutic benefits. Some studies suggest it could help people suffering from long COVID or Alzheimer’s disease. This emerging perspective could change how we understand and use nicotine in modern medicine.
