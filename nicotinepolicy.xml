The transition, progressing rapidly in countries like Sweden and Japan, offers hope in ending smoking. Despite the reduced harm of new nicotine products, efforts to accelerate the switch face resistance. Influential bodies like WHO and nonprofits like Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids oppose e-cigarettes. Supported by Bloomberg, they hinder progress in low- and middle-income countries by advocating against safer options.

North Dakota abandoned its proposal due to advocacy efforts, emphasizing American-made items. Fear-based policymaking and misinformation still influence decisions, impacting harm reduction progress. The political shift reflects trade interests more than public health. However, the compromised bills in Tennessee and North Dakota preserve access to nicotine alternatives, pending Governor Lee's approval. Challenges persist for over 650,000 adult vapers in these states amidst ongoing regulatory uncertainties. (Published on May 02, 2025byfiltermag.org)</description></item></channel></rss>
