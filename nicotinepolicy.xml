Dual users of both have similar exposure to nicotine and carcinogens as exclusive cigarette smokers. Tobacco cessation programs are urged as a safer alternative, as dual-use is deemed ineffective for health protection. Clinicians are advised to promote awareness on the risks of dual-use, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based cessation programs. Stronger FDA regulation of tobacco products, including illegal ones, is recommended to safeguard public health. The research underscores the need to prioritize tobacco prevention and cessation efforts.

He stated that products like vapes reduce harmful substances and should be used more to aid smoking cessation, with harm reduction being crucial. Khayat emphasized the importance of regulatory frameworks balancing access and preventing youth uptake of these alternatives. With smoking causing eight million global deaths yearly, he urged smokers to consider safer alternatives. Khayat's views align with a cardiologist's stance on nicotine's non-carcinogenic and non-heart-disease-causing properties, pointing towards tobacco harm reduction discussions at an upcoming WHO conference.
