Trading Standards reported a 112% increase in seizures, with over 8,000 confiscated in a year. Nicotine pouches are popular among teenagers due to their flavors and packaging but can lead to nicotine poisoning. Experts suggest regulating their nicotine content to protect public health. Concerns include accidental ingestion by children, addiction, and adverse effects on mental health. Legislation aims to prevent sales to minors and curb appealing branding, but calls for further restrictions persist.
