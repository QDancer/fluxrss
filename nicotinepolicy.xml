Scientific studies support that e-cigarettes are at least 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes. The WVA emphasizes that transitioning to these alternatives can reduce exposure to harmful substances, potentially lowering cancer risk. The WVA advocates for the acceptance of harm reduction strategies by the World Health Organization to aid in smoking cessation. This evidence-based approach has proven successful in countries like Sweden, the UK, and New Zealand. Vaping has been found to be twice as effective as nicotine replacement therapies in quitting smoking. Policymakers are urged to consider a variety of harm-reduction tools to reduce smoking-related diseases and improve public health outcomes.
