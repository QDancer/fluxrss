The research indicates that implementing WHO's recommended 75% tax could have potentially saved over 280,000 children's lives. The study analyzed data from 94 countries between 2008-2020, showing how increased cigarette taxes can improve child survival across all socioeconomic groups. Lead author Olivia Bannon emphasizes the importance of raising cigarette taxes to protect children's health, particularly in vulnerable populations. The study highlights the need to combat tobacco industry interference to implement effective tobacco control policies globally.

They argue that flavours help smokers switch to safer options and caution against unintended consequences seen in Denmark. The ban risks driving former smokers back to cigarettes and the black market. Data shows adult vapers prefer flavoured products. Experts recommend science-based regulations that protect public health while supporting harm reduction. In Denmark, a ban on vape flavours unintentionally increased youth use and spurred illegal sales. Critics warn against over-regulation and point to Sweden's harm reduction success. Research confirms flavoured vapes aid smoking cessation. Advocates call for evidence-based policies to safeguard gains in public health.

This emerging trend raises concerns, mirroring the past rise of flavored e-cigarettes. The FDA's decision to allow marketing of Zyn pouches to adults is controversial, given their popularity among teens. Research shows a demographic pattern favoring white males in rural areas. Both nicotine pouch and e-cigarette use increased in 2024, with more teens engaging in dual use. Long-term health effects are uncertain, but addiction risks persist. Preventative measures and regulation are crucial to address this public health issue. Tracking trends and evaluating policies are essential for targeted prevention strategies.

This comes as PMI pushes to end cigarette sales. With Robert F. Kennedy Jr. now leading the Department of Health and Human Services, there may be major changes in tobacco regulation. Meanwhile, PMI's nicotine pouch brand Zyn is seeing rapid growth in the U.S., with shipments in the Americas up nearly 54% in Q1 2025. Smoke-free products now make up 42% of PMI's revenue, compared to 25% a year ago. Although PMI still earns most of its revenue from smokers, that could soon shift due to Zyn’s rising popularity.
