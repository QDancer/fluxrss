While vapes helped 28.4% quit compared to 9.6% with NRT, 58% continued vaping after quitting smoking. Australia has high smoking rates among socially disadvantaged groups, despite lower overall rates. Vapes offer a promising option for smokers who struggle to quit, but the long-term safety of vaping is uncertain. The study suggests tailored vaping options and support are crucial for successful cessation. Health professionals should consider vaping as a cessation aid for individuals who have not quit with traditional therapies.

These pouches, marketed as a safer alternative for adults, are addicting a new generation to nicotine, undoing public health progress. Nicotine poses significant health risks, impacting brain development and increasing addiction. Pouches, with various flavors and high nicotine content, appeal to youths with discreet use and social media marketing. Policy solutions include restricting access, banning flavors, and curbing advertising, despite opposition from tobacco companies. These companies, targeting young users, aim to maintain a steady demand for nicotine products. (Published on July 15, 2025bywashingtonpost.com)</description></item></channel></rss>
