These pouches lack proper approval for sale, leading to legal issues and public health concerns. Despite potential harm reduction benefits, the inconsistency in regulating these products has left consumers and sellers in a precarious situation. The debate on nicotine pouches, also known as snus, highlights the need for comprehensive legislation to address their sale, composition, and taxation. Failure to establish clear guidelines risks impacting public health, revenue collection, and the prevalence of illicit sales. Addressing these issues through regulation rather than prohibition could provide a more effective solution. (Published on January 20, 2026bycyprus-mail.com)</description></item></channel></rss>
