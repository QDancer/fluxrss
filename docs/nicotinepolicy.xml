Despite arguments for its harm reduction, research shows filtered cigarettes lower lung cancer risk compared to unfiltered ones. Opponents claim filters mislead smokers, suggesting a ban without considering consumer beliefs or overall health impacts. Evidence suggests filters may indeed offer some protection. Conflicting views exist within the anti-smoking lobby on tobacco regulation strategies. Ethical concerns and contradictory stances surround the debate, such as the effectiveness of low tar cigarettes and the implications of banning filters. The argument for a ban lacks a clear justification and overlooks potential consequences on smoking-related diseases. (Published on October 20, 2025bysubstack.com)</description></item></channel></rss>
