The program, funded by Proposition 56, provided education and activities that significantly reduced tobacco use rates. TUPE-funded schools saw more prevention education and anti-tobacco activities, contributing to lower tobacco use compared to non-TUPE schools. The findings highlight the importance of investing in effective prevention strategies to safeguard young people from addiction. School-based prevention programs, when combined with strong policies, play a key role in comprehensive tobacco control efforts, offering long-term public health benefits.

These outdated regulations work against public health goals. As a result, smokers are denied access to tools that could help them quit and save lives.
