The changes include higher taxes on cigarettes, fine-cut tobacco, cigars, cigarillos, heated tobacco, and e-liquids. Cigarette excise duty increased to €56.10 per 1,000 cigarettes, with other tobacco products also facing tax hikes. Notably, e-liquids used in electronic cigarettes will now be taxed at €0.20 per millilitre. These adjustments are projected to generate an extra €74.7 million for the state budget and have public health benefits.

Research shows awareness of health risks and the belief that tobacco helps cope with emotional distress drive usage. Factors like easy access and parental influence double the risk. Emphasizing emotional motives over health risks in prevention efforts is crucial. Nicotine exposure affects brain development and increases substance dependence risk. Policies targeting emotional reasons for use, integrating mental health support, and expanding services are necessary. School-based interventions and community support play vital roles in curbing adolescent tobacco use effectively. (Published on June 13, 2025bytheconversation.com)</description></item></channel></rss>
