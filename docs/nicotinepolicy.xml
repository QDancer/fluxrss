Data shows cigarettes are the main source of poisonings among children. Nicotine pouches, accounting for 1.4% of cases, have seen a rise in incidents. These pouches, easier to swallow, lead to more hospitalizations and complications. Child-resistant packaging for e-liquids reduced liquid nicotine poisonings by half. Some pouch brands have safety features, but there are concerns about non-approved products. Innovative solutions like ClicCan aim to enhance pouch security. Despite rising numbers, most incidents involve very young children at home. Brands should prioritize safety, but personal vigilance is crucial for child protection.
