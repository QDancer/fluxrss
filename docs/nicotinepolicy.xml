These devices, favored by youth, deliver nicotine efficiently, especially to non-smokers. Researchers compared pod-style e-cigarettes to nicotine gum in nonsmoking young adults and found e-cigarettes more satisfying and craving-reducing. The appeal of these devices lies in the use of nicotine salts, which lessen the unpleasant taste of higher nicotine levels. The study emphasizes the addictive potential of e-cigarettes, particularly among inexperienced users like youth and young adults, prompting caution.
