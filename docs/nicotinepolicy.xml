Published in Preventative Medicine, it aimed to explore effects on smoking during pregnancy. Yet, critics argue VLNCs may not decrease smoking and could be as harmful. The FDA proposed reducing nicotine in tobacco, claiming it could prevent deaths. However, opponents question its efficacy and advocate for safer alternatives like vaping. The study found VLNCs didn‚Äôt reduce smoking in pregnant women but also didn't lead to more smoking. Researchers defended the study's ethical standards, stating it was not a smoking-cessation trial but part of a national policy investigation. Critics, like Dr. Michael Siegel, demand retraction, citing ethical violations.

This mechanism explains why these substances reinforce consumption behavior while inducing anxiety. Researchers used optogenetics to block this loop and prevent anxious behavior. The study sheds light on the link between reward and negative emotions, providing insights into addiction and co-use of tobacco and alcohol.

Supporters argue these products are marketed to youth and minority communities. A coalition is pushing to repeal the ban, collecting over 17,000 signatures. Proponents, such as health organizations, formed Denver Kids vs Big Tobacco to promote the ban. Critics, led by the Rocky Mountain Smoke Free Alliance, advocate for stricter regulations instead. The ban's fate will be determined by voters this November, shaping Denver's stance against the tobacco industry. The move follows a vetoed 2021 ban and aligns Denver with other Colorado cities combatting flavored tobacco.
