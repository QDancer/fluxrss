Facing reluctance from peers, she transitioned to the private sector, critical of academic politics. Selya utilized longitudinal studies and population trends to challenge the hypothesis, noting declines in overall tobacco use despite the rise of vaping. She highlights academic groupthink and institutional funding pressures shaping the anti-vaping narrative. Moving to the industry for research freedom, Selya remains focused on unbiased analysis.
