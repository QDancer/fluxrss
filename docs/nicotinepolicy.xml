Current policies risk pushing users to more harmful options by banning safer alternatives. Global experiences, like the Maldives' vape ban leading to increased illicit tobacco activity, caution against overly restrictive measures. Advocates urge for inclusive policies at COP11, calling for innovation and consumer voices in tobacco control. Differentiated tax regimes, as seen in Japan and New Zealand, can reduce smoking rates. Hong Kong's tobacco policy should prioritize harm reduction to achieve effective public health outcomes instead of solely focusing on control and punishment.
