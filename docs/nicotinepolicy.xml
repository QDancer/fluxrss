Both groups face addiction, health risks, and stigmas. Support for harm reduction tools like syringe programs and e-cigarettes can improve health outcomes. Political divides, misinformation, and discomfort hinder progress. Bridging the gap and recognizing commonalities could lead to a more effective, holistic approach. Recent efforts show promise in integrating harm reduction strategies. Encouraging collaboration between drug and tobacco harm reduction supporters is crucial for comprehensive support. Recognizing shared challenges can help create a united front transcending ideological differences. (Published on May 21, 2025byrstreet.org)</description></item><item><title>The Real Threat? The Hypocrisy Behind Flavored Vape Bans</title><link>https://worldvapersalliance.com/the-real-threat-the-hypocrisy-behind-flavored-vape-bans-while-flavored-alcohol-gets-a-free-pass/</link><description>The U.S. crackdown on flavored vapes raises concerns of a double standard compared to alcohol products marketed with kid-friendly flavors. Despite alcohol's proven harm to youths, focus remains on banning vapes to safeguard minors, overlooking their role in harm reduction for adult smokers. Sweeping bans benefit big tobacco, shutting out small vape shops and effective quitting tools. To truly prioritize public health, the government should regulate flavored vapes like alcohol, fund education, and support safer vape products while addressing adult smokers' needs. The struggle against flavored vapes reflects control issues rather than youth protection, urging a shift towards harm reduction recognition and better policy decisions.

Disposable vapes will soon be banned in the UK, with concerns about their impact on health. While vaping may have fewer harmful chemicals than traditional smoking, it still poses risks like chronic lung damage. The long-term effects of vaping are still being studied, but evidence suggests it could lead to reduced lung function and skin issues over time. Traditional smoking has more immediate negative impacts, including cardiovascular strain and lung damage.

They have demonized, taxed, restricted, and banned safer nicotine products. They’ve misrepresented science and misinformed the public, all in a misguided effort to eliminate nicotine use entirely. But U.S. consumers aren’t buying it. They’re rejecting the panic, sidestepping the bans, and switching to nicotine vapes by the millions.  According to Goldman Sachs, sales of smoke-free nicotine products will overtake combustible cigarettes in the U.S. this year. It’s a seismic shift in the nicotine market, and yet public health remains silent. Joining RegWatch to break down this realignment is Dr. Charles Gardner, a key figure in tobacco harm reduction and a relentless advocate for evidence-based public health. Gardner says the age of smoking is ending and almost nobody knows it.

BIR suggested different tax rates for vapes to prevent revenue loss. Concerns over vape use by adolescents were raised, with a 40% increase since 2021. Measures like excise stamps were implemented to regulate vape products. Senate deliberations include proposals to amend tobacco excise taxes to address illicit trade. PMFTC recommended an odd-even tax scheme for tobacco products to enhance revenue. Enforcement against illicit trade is considered crucial over tax adjustments. The aim is to balance tax rates while combating illegal activities in the industry.

The bill, which received strong support with 417 votes in favor, now moves to the Senate and, if approved, will go to the president for signing. This ban is part of wider reforms to Poland’s tobacco and vaping laws, aiming to better protect young people from nicotine addiction and related health risks, as previous legislation did not address newer nicotine products.

Despite strains on global healthcare, the WHO diverts funds into unrestricted areas instead of vital programs like polio eradication. The organization's top-heavy structure allows excessive spending, including lavish staff benefits. The WHO's move towards unaccountable core funding shifts focus from critical health initiatives to administrative expansion. To improve transparency, trim senior compensations, and prioritize patient care, national governments must demand reforms before approving contribution hikes. The WHO should prioritize patient needs over bureaucracy.

Recent adoption of harm reduction products like heated tobacco has led to significant reductions in cigarette consumption. The WHO's skepticism despite scientific evidence hinders progress. Illicit cigarette trade is growing due to bans on flavored HTPs. Hungary needs to consider the efficacy of harm reduction at COP11 to address the limitations of traditional anti-smoking policies.

Proposals hint at limiting nicotine levels and antagonizing flavors. Regulatory policies seek good intentions but may raise smoking rates and create black markets. U.S. regulations delay reduced-risk products, favoring large companies. Flavors aid smoking cessation, especially with adult smokers. Bans can boost cigarette sales and illicit markets, endangering public health. The focus should be on evidence-based regulations allowing flavored options for adult smokers while curbing youth access. The goal is to reduce smoking-related harm through pragmatic approaches.
