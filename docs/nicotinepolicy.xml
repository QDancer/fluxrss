In this episode of RegWatch, behavioral scientist Dr. Arielle Selya unpacks the Commissioner’s claims. From “popcorn lung,” to the conflation of nicotine vaping with illicit THC products, to the astonishing assertion that principals and doctors “know better” than national surveillance data, the episode exposes a regulator who has fallen prey to the anti-vaping narrative he was supposed to evaluate objectively.

Concerned about health impacts due to insufficient assessment, Martin supports stricter measures. The UK government aims to ban vaping in various public spaces to protect children and patients from second-hand smoke. A consultation process seeks input on implementing bans and educating the public. The UK plans to create regulations under the tobacco and vapes Bill for a smoke-free generation. In Ireland, efforts are underway to restrict vape advertising and sales, including banning single-use vapes. Martin advocates for reducing vape usage and addressing health risks, emphasizing the need for continuous review and action.
