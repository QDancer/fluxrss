He highlights the hypocrisy of countries like China pushing for extreme measures while profiting from tobacco at home. Vobořil notes the exclusion of harm reduction and consumer voices in favor of well-funded NGOs linked to major donors, leading to a one-sided discussion. The focus on debunked myths instead of successful harm reduction strategies is alarming. He emphasizes the importance of evidence-based policies to save lives and warns of the consequences of ignoring science. The WHO must prioritize innovation and transparency to regain public trust and prevent unnecessary deaths.

Despite strengthening tobacco control measures, smoking remains dominant. African governments must choose to enable safer alternatives or regulate all nicotine equally. The tension between traditional control and harm reduction approaches is growing. Countries like South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Zambia face key decisions on regulating novel nicotine products. Risk-proportionate regulation could lead to decreased smoking rates and healthcare costs. The continent's public health narrative now focuses on accelerating harm reduction alongside tobacco control efforts to combat smoking effectively.

This type of injury is common in liver surgery and transplants, leading to oxidative stress and inflammation. Nicotinic acid's protective effects surpass N-acetylcysteine by targeting damaged mitochondria, as shown in experiments on mice and hepatocytes. The treatment not only reduces liver injury markers and inflammation but also enhances mitochondrial quality by promoting mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. With its safety, affordability, and availability, nicotinic acid shows promise for improving outcomes in liver surgery, prompting upcoming human trials.

Despite efforts like the WHO's focus on vaccination, screening, and treatment, limitations exist including the HPV vaccine not covering all cancer-causing strains. Smoking doubles the risk for cervical cancer as tobacco-related compounds harm cervical cells and immune function. Secondhand smoke exposure is also linked to the disease. Urgent action on tobacco smoke prevention is crucial in cancer prevention strategies. Emphasizing smoke exposure reduction alongside vaccination and screening can save more lives. It's essential to educate on risk reduction options, especially for those who choose to use nicotine. (Published on January 06, 2026byfiltermag.org)</description></item></channel></rss>
