Brits could face five years in jail and a £320,000 fine. The crackdown has been criticized as disproportionate, with warnings that well-meaning tourists could unknowingly break the law. The ban, the strictest in Europe, aims to preserve public health but has sparked controversy. It may lead to a black market and affect athletes using pouches for performance enhancement. Despite concerns, French officials proceeded with the ban, leaving many questioning the logic of making carrying a pouch more dangerous than carrying heroin.

Despite evidence supporting the effectiveness of harm reduction products like e-cigarettes, the WHO continues to advocate for restricting access to these alternatives. While concerns about youth vaping are valid, data shows a decline in usage. The WHO's approach neglects the reasons why youth turn to vaping, such as stress relief. Prioritizing youth protection over adult harm reduction fails to address the complexities of smoking cessation. A shift towards acknowledging and supporting adult smokers in accessing all cessation options is essential for effective global tobacco control efforts.
