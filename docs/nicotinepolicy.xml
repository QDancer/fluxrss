The plan faces opposition from countries with lower tax rates and those investing in innovative tobacco. Italy warns against hindering innovation, as sharp tax hikes could increase smuggling. Concerns are raised over proposed high taxes on new tobacco products lacking EU regulation. The push for a unified EU policy on alternative tobacco products is suggested to address rising smuggling issues. Drastic tax hikes may not be suitable now, as they could strain resources and enforcement without substantial benefits.

The WHO's prohibitionist stance was deemed counterproductive, with calls to prioritize saving lives over endorsing failed policies. Despite evidence showing harm reduction methods help smokers quit, the WHO's resistance to such tools was seen as detrimental to public health.
