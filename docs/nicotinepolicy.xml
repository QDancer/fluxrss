This makes Israel one of the first countries to extend such regulations to all tobacco and nicotine products. The decision comes just days before World No Tobacco Day, as the Israel Cancer Association revealed alarming data: 31% of Israeli smokers began or resumed smoking due to stress and anxiety related to the war that started on October 7, 2023.

Advocates urge him to consult experts, as anti-vape policies unfold in the EU. Varhelyi's claims of vaping being as harmful as smoking and causing "popcorn lung" are refuted by scientific evidence. The European Tobacco Harm Reduction Advocates express concerns over misinformation influencing regulations that restrict safer nicotine products. They emphasize the need for policy decisions based on facts, not myths. Varhelyi's role includes spearheading initiatives to reduce cancer rates linked to smoking in the EU, despite vaping's proven role in smoking cessation. Requests for a meeting to address misinformation have been made, aiming to safeguard public health decisions.

They believe the WHO's approach fuels black markets and smoking-related deaths, dismissing evidence supporting harm reduction as effective. Panelists highlighted the importance of embracing innovation and consumer input to combat the global smoking epidemic. The WHO's prohibitionist stance was deemed counterproductive, with calls to prioritize saving lives over endorsing failed policies. Despite evidence showing harm reduction methods help smokers quit, the WHO's resistance to such tools was seen as detrimental to public health.
