Despite promises since 2021, the government has not implemented the ban. Concerns are raised about the popularity of vaping among students, prompting advocacy groups like SAAVE and Action on Smoking and Health to seek direct discussions with ministers at the upcoming meeting in Calgary. The focus is on protecting young Canadians from the allure of flavored vaping products. (Published on October 16, 2025byglobalnews.ca)</description></item></channel></rss>
