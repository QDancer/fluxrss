Concerns remain about the rising popularity of alternative nicotine products among young people, such as e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches. The Cancer Foundation calls for regulations to protect youth from these products. High levels of passive smoking were also highlighted. Efforts to help residents quit smoking are increasing, with 46% expressing a desire to quit, rising to 62% among 16- to 24-year-olds. A support campaign coinciding with World No Tobacco Day aims to assist those wanting to quit.
