The proposal includes raising prices on nicotine pouches by over 50% and adding €3 to a 10ml bottle of vaping liquid. Hoekstra is reaching out to national officials for support, targeting countries resistant to the tax hike. While some Commission members question the economic timing, Hoekstra remains adamant against nicotine products, claiming vapes are as harmful as cigarettes. Climate change policy also falls under Hoekstra's jurisdiction, sparking criticism for prioritizing vaping taxes over environmental issues. Resistance from Member States and skepticism within the Commission may hinder the tax plan approval.

Tobacco Harm Reduction (THR), including e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products, offers a safer alternative. However, lack of awareness and regulation hinders progress. Local research and educational campaigns are needed to promote THR and develop effective policies. Integrating THR into national tobacco control is crucial for long-term health outcomes. With the new Tobacco Control Law in place, Cameroon has the opportunity to lead in tobacco control through evidence-based, innovative strategies. Action is imperative to reduce smoking-related harm and improve public health.

The Ministry of Health warns about e-cigarettes' nicotine content, leading to severe health issues like lung disease and cancer. The PM's decision comes after reports of illegal e-cigarette sales despite the existing ban. Hun Manet's stance aims to protect the public from harmful effects associated with smoking and vaping.

This approach results in decreased tax revenues and undermines public health efforts. The study focused on Ukraine, where HTPs are taxed similarly to cigarettes. While tobacco companies promote HTPs as safer alternatives, evidence on their health impacts remains inconclusive. Tax harmonization, as seen in Ukraine, aligns with WHO recommendations to prevent market manipulation. The researchers stress the importance of taxing HTPs appropriately and urge policymakers to prioritize public health over industry profits.

These approaches have dramatically reduced smoking rates and related deaths. Advocates urge South Africa to prioritize adult access to safer options to replicate this success and improve public health outcomes. Policymakers are encouraged to learn from successful international models and create a distinction between harmful tobacco products and safer alternatives. Ultimately, the focus is on saving lives through evidence-based approaches.

A voracious demand for negative stories about vapes exists, contrasting with the reality of zero deaths from vaping in 20 years. This phenomenon, coined Vapehausen-by-proxy syndrome, mirrors Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Manipulative tales about vaping seek attention and sympathy, spreading misinformation and unfounded claims to attract attention in the attention economy. Various examples of fabricated stories surrounding vaping illustrate the lengths some go to manipulate public opinion. It is crucial to critically assess such narratives and acknowledge the lack of substantiated evidence linking vaping to significant harm or death.

The report argues that electronic cigarettes and nicotine pouches are currently the most effective tools for reducing smoking and criticizes the WHO’s outdated stance against harm reduction. Marking the 20th anniversary of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the paper claims that opposition to harm reduction has slowed progress and cost lives. It outlines 20 lessons, emphasizing the need to regulate nicotine products based on risk rather than banning them. The report cites research from Public Health England showing that vaping exposes users to at least 95% fewer toxins than traditional smoking.
