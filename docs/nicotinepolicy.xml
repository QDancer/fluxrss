Equating vaping to the leading cause of death misleads the public. While smoking rates have declined, the city demonizes vaping rather than celebrating its role in smoking cessation. Crackdowns on vaping products prevail, while ignoring the benefits they offer smokers. The city's lawsuit against flavored vapes exemplifies a misguided focus on youth appeal, neglecting adult preferences. Disregarding harm reduction principles, the city's stance on nicotine perpetuates cigarette consumption over safer alternatives. The campaign reflects a lack of access to truthful health information and obstructs progress towards saving lives.

A recent article in theNew England Journal of Medicine, titled"The IARC Perspective on the Effects of Policies on Reducing Alcohol Consumption", advocates for prohibition as an evidence-based measure. However, a disclaimer at the end of the article states that the views expressed do not necessarily reflect those of IARC or the WHO, raising questions about how it can be called an "IARC perspective" at all.

Although smoking rates in the U.S. have declined since the mid-20th century, about 29 million Americans still smoke. Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., responsible for around 500,000 deaths annually, including 125,000 from lung cancer. E-cigarettes were created specifically to tackle this public health crisis by providing nicotine to dependent users without the harmful chemicals found in traditional cigarettes.

In a 12-week trial paired with counseling, 51% of participants on varenicline abstained from vaping, compared to 14% on a placebo. The drug's effectiveness continued post-trial, with a 28% abstinence rate at 24 weeks. Vaping in adolescents can lead to nicotine addiction, impacting brain development. State laws on treating minors vary, posing challenges for underage patients seeking help. Varenicline, binding to nicotine receptors, reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Dr. McGee suggests discussing quitting with parents and considers varenicline as a treatment option for young patients.
