New Zealand has successfully reduced youth vaping rates by implementing strict regulations without hindering harm reduction. The country's approach includes penalties for selling to minors and limiting marketing tactics. New Zealand's success in reducing smoking and youth vaping challenges misinformation and fear-mongering. In contrast, Australia's stringent vape restrictions have not yielded the same public health benefits. While New Zealand has made significant progress, challenges remain, especially among indigenous Māori youth. (Published on January 29, 2026byfiltermag.org)</description></item></channel></rss>
