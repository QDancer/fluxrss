The organization urges governments to tailor taxation to reflect risks accurately, citing successful examples in Japan, the Philippines, and New Zealand. CAPHRA stresses the importance of aligning tax policies with scientific evidence to empower individuals to make informed health choices and avoid creating black markets.
