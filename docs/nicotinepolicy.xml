At GFN 2025 in Warsaw, Adriana Curado of GAT in Lisbon shows how nicotine became “the forgotten substance.” From her own move away from smoking to a pioneering vaping project with people who use drugs and those experiencing homelessness, Curado exposes public health contradictions, the persistence of stigma, and why safer nicotine options matter—especially for marginalized groups.

Factors like availability, various flavors, and online promotion contribute to the popularity. While vaping is seen as less harmful than smoking tobacco, health risks remain. Doctors recommend stricter controls on access to these products. In the UAE, 23% of students had vaped in the past month, indicating a growing trend. Flavors attract many users, but doctors suggest vapes for smokers aiming to quit. Concerns arise over the high prevalence among young adults. UAE authorities are urged to adapt regulations as the nicotine market evolves rapidly.

Measures to implement the tax, aimed at curbing youth vaping, are in advanced stages. The government is also increasing restrictions on vaping, including bans on sales to those under 18 and plans to prohibit disposable vapes along with stricter rules on flavors and advertising. Enforcement of regulations is crucial, with concerns raised about retail compliance and the need for effective prosecution of offenders.

What is Labour smoking?</title><link>https://www.spiked-online.com/2025/09/23/banning-vaping-in-public-what-is-labour-smoking/</link><description>The UK government plans to ban vaping in public places, claiming health risks without scientific evidence. Public Health England emphasized the negligible harm of secondhand vaping in 2015 and 2018. Recent research also supports this, finding minimal health risks for bystanders. The proposed ban lacks evidence of significant risks, potentially hindering smokers from switching to safer alternatives. Critics argue it's a disproportionate restriction that harms harm-reduction efforts and reinforces negative perceptions of vaping. Public health policies should be evidence-based. Banning vaping without proven risks undermines harm reduction and individual freedoms, contrary to the government's successful smoking cessation programs. This overcautious approach may perpetuate smoking and stigmatize vaping. (Published on September 23, 2025byspiked-online.com)</description></item></channel></rss>
