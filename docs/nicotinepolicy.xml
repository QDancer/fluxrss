Nicotine pouches contain nicotine but no tobacco, reducing lung damage risks. Dr. Mallick explained the pouches release nicotine without smoke, aiding in quitting smoking due to reduced cravings. However, they can be addictive, and long-term health effects are still being studied. Nicotine pouches work through oral mucosal absorption, unlike patches. While they may help some smokers quit, their effectiveness compared to traditional nicotine replacement therapies remains uncertain. The UAE regulates nicotine product sales, with warnings and age restrictions required. Despite health risks, the UAE is dedicated to supporting tobacco cessation through counseling and psychological aid.
