The World Conference on Tobacco Control overlooks harm reduction strategies, favoring prohibitionist policies influenced by figures like Michael Bloomberg and the WHO. The upcoming COP11 and EU regulations could shape future nicotine policies, potentially blocking safer alternatives. Despite successful harm reduction examples in certain countries, the EU is leaning towards restrictive measures like flavor bans and tax hikes. Advocates emphasize the need for evidence-based, consumer-centric policies to combat smoking-related illnesses. Policymakers face a crucial decision: prioritize public health or maintain outdated ideologies at the expense of consumer well-being.
