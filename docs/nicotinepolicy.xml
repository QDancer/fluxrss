Published in Cureus (part of Springer Nature) on August 5, the authors’ bias is evident from the title alone. The paper claims to be a narrative review examining the “rising” public health concerns related to youth vaping, including its prevalence, health risks, and regulatory responses. In reality, this so-called “review” is a smorgasbord of debunked falsehoods about tobacco harm reduction products.

The sweeping reform, designed to align with the EU’s Beating Cancer Plan and introduce minimum tax levels on novel nicotine products like vapes and pouches, has drawn praise from public health advocates.
