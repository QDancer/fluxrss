The legislation, backed by 197 MPs, also targets energy drinks marketed to minors. Lead sponsor Professor Kostadin Angelov suggests the ban may focus on disposable vapes for quicker implementation due to regulatory obstacles. The European Commission must be notified due to potential trade impacts. Smoke Free Sweden opposes the ban, cautioning against hindering tobacco harm reduction efforts in Europe, as it may push ex-smokers back to smoking.

British American Tobacco expects a mid-teens percentage decline in global vape sales in the first half of the year. In the US, regulated e-cigarette sales have dropped almost every month for the past two years, while in the UK, vaping rates have stagnated.

Snapchat responded by stating their prohibition of illegal activities and use of detection technology. The doctors aim to protect children and may escalate the issue to authorities if demands are not met.

However, public health advocates warn against drastic tax cuts. The excise, which has tripled in the past decade, comprises a major portion of cigarette prices. Despite successful past policies reducing smoking rates, current measures are ineffective. Border seizures of illegal tobacco have surged, prompting calls for stronger enforcement over tax decreases. Experts argue that the excise level has become counterproductive, suggesting a temporary radical cut. The excise rate, now heavily indexed and escalating annually, needs revision to combat illicit tobacco trade. (Published on June 11, 2025bytheguardian.com)</description></item></channel></rss>
