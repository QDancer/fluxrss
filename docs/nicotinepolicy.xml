Severe penalties now include fines, caning, and jail time. Customs officers are vigilant, finding hidden vapes in various vehicles at checkpoints. An extensive public health campaign warns of vaping dangers, with a hotline for reporting offenders. The government aims to prevent a rise in drug usage, particularly targeting youths.
