The law aims to reduce secondhand smoke exposure and protect health. Supporters highlight health benefits and tourism appeal, while opponents argue it infringes on individual rights and hurts businesses. The law covers traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and tobacco products, with penalties for non-compliance. The ban aligns with European clean air directives and aims to curb smoking-related diseases. Public opinion is divided, but the majority supports the new regulations. Republika Srpska joins the Federation of BiH in becoming smoke-free, with RS enforcing stricter penalties than the Federation.
