However, the high cost of such alternatives remains a major concern. South Africa has over 8.6 million smokers, and smoking causes around 32,000 deaths each year, according to Tobacco Control Data. Companies like Philip Morris International (PMI) argue that smoke-free products such as nicotine pouches could play a crucial role in cutting smoking-related deaths.

He criticizes vaping as dangerous and aims to eliminate it globally. Despite strict tobacco controls in Belgium, smoking rates stagnate at 21%, with new bans on nicotine pouches and disposable vapes creating a thriving black market. Vandenbroucke plans to involve ministers worldwide in the seminar, but the public's role remains unclear. Efforts to reduce smoking without new policies have proven ineffective, with reports of ongoing sales of banned products in Belgium.

British Columbia has already won a $3.6 billion settlement from tobacco companies over 18 years and now plans similar legal action against vaping firms. The structure of the lawsuit and the health-care costs linked to vaping are still being determined. While manufacturers claim vaping helps smokers quit tobacco, Sharma argues that because e-cigarettes contain addictive nicotine, they merely replace one harmful habit with another.

Now It Will Tax Vapes Hard.</title><link>https://filtermag.org/ireland-high-vape-tax/</link><description>Ireland will implement a tax of €0.50 per milliliter on all vaping e-liquids, becoming the highest in the EU. The government aims to further restrict vape products and flavors, despite missing smoke-free targets. Advocates argue that high vape taxes hinder smoking cessation efforts, especially as vapes were aiding in reducing smoking rates. The tax is viewed as counterproductive, disproportionately affecting low-income individuals and leading to a potential rise in smoking and black-market product use. While the government cites youth protection and reducing accessibility, critics believe it penalizes smokers trying to quit. The tax contradicts evidence showing affordable vape access aids in smoking cessation.

Implementing FCTC's Articles 9 and 10 to lower toxic emissions has been delayed, highlighting the need for setting emission thresholds for toxicants. A shift towards a science-based regulatory approach, targeting priority toxicants, can accelerate harm reduction for the 1 billion smokers worldwide. The upcoming 11th FCTC Conference of the Parties in 2025 offers an opportunity to develop a toxicity reduction strategy. A dynamic, evidence-based regulatory framework, similar to other sectors, can enhance public health by categorizing products based on emission benchmarks and promoting harmful product awareness through clear labeling.

The research emphasizes the impact of advertising on public health goals for smoking cessation. Insurance coverage influences how ads affect behavior, with strong coverage leading to larger declines in cigarette sales. Ads for prescription products also boosted demand for alternative methods. The study highlights how the effectiveness of advertising depends on therapy accessibility and affordability. Policymakers should consider these findings when regulating pharmaceutical advertising. The research analyzed advertising effects on cigarette consumption, showing that a 10% reduction in ads leads to increased cigarette sales.

This bill aims to combat illicit tobacco and e-cigarettes by granting authorities new inspection and penalty powers. The reforms also enhance seizure provisions and officer safety measures. This initiative follows the alignment of vaping laws with federal regulations. Additionally, the government plans to provide substantial funding for smoking and vaping cessation support services. These measures signal a strong stance against illicit tobacco trading, emphasizing collaboration with other jurisdictions.

A study found high nicotine levels, surpassing legal limits. NGOs call for stricter enforcement, highlighting the company's power and profit in Taiwan's tobacco market. Health authorities clarify that heated tobacco's health risks are equivalent to regular cigarettes if nicotine levels exceed 1 milligram per stick.
