Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) is effective in aiding smoking cessation, but older smokers face barriers such as cost and access. Combining NRT with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and social support can enhance quitting success. Additionally, promoting non-combustible nicotine products like e-cigarettes can offer alternative quitting methods. To support smoking cessation among older Americans, tailored education, accessible resources, and policy interventions are crucial to increase awareness and decrease environmental triggers. Providing a variety of cessation options is essential for improving the health outcomes of older smokers.
