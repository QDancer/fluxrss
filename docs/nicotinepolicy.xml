Key points include restrictions on sales near schools, bans on advertising, and proposed penalties for violations. The bill also sets standards for packaging and nicotine levels, with strict age verification for online sales. If passed, vaping would be prohibited in various public settings. Violators could face fines up to Rs50,000. Ministries are finalizing enforcement measures before presenting the bill in the Senate.

Combustible cigarettes pose significant health risks due to the toxic chemicals from combustion. Smoke-free options like vaping and heated tobacco offer lower risks, aiding in smoking cessation when properly regulated. Bans and high prices protect the cigarette market but harm public health. Governments like Vietnam and Bangladesh have enforced bans, while countries like New Zealand and Sweden have successfully reduced smoking through pragmatic regulations. Embracing harm reduction, rather than prohibition, can save lives in the Asia-Pacific region, where smoking-related deaths are high.
