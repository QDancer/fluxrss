It found that in states where recreational marijuana was legalized, monthly marijuana use increased by 3.28% and tobacco e-cigarette use rose by 1.39%. These increases accelerated after marijuana dispensaries opened. However, there was no significant change in the number of people smoking traditional cigarettes. Experts express concern over the rising use of vapes and cannabis, especially as todayâ€™s marijuana is more potent and potentially more harmful than in the past.
