The narrative of safer nicotine is challenged, emphasizing all forms are harmful. Recommendations include flavor bans and taxation proportional to nicotine content. Critics question the validity of the report's findings and policy goals. They argue for harm reduction, citing examples like Swedish snus. The report's stance against safer nicotine products is viewed suspiciously by advocates. It aligns with EU debates on tobacco regulations. Supporters of harm reduction stress its role in reducing smoking rates. The report's timing coincides with EU health plans, raising concerns about its influence.
