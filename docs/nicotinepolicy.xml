The law prohibits their import, production, sale, and use, aiming for clearer regulation and enforcement. Heated tobacco products are not considered e-cigarettes under the law. Changes to the Tax Code and Advertising Law accompany the ban, with disposable e-cigarettes no longer subject to taxes. Effective April 1, 2026, the legislation addresses the import, export, manufacture, storage, distribution, and use of these products within the country.
