Dr. Wan Puteh highlights risks of illegal markets and potential harm to smokers. Banning vapes may increase illicit trade and harm public health, as seen in neighboring countries. Advocates suggest legalizing and regulating to ensure consumer safety. The ban could impact over 30,000 workers and a billion-dollar industry. They urge the government to consider a balanced regulatory approach that supports harm reduction. The move aims to protect public health and prevent the proliferation of unsafe products in the market.

The £1.46 million project funded by the MRC will monitor 200 participants over a year, comparing their lung health to non-smokers. Researchers will analyze gene expression, toxic substance accumulation, and lung cell changes to understand vaping's impact on health. This study is crucial given the WHO's concerns about rising global vaping rates. The aim is to provide evidence for individuals to make informed decisions about quitting smoking with e-cigarettes.

The Ministry seeks to align vape taxes with those on cigarettes to discourage vaping. Industry representatives push back, suggesting a maximum tax of 80 sen per milliliter to prevent increased illicit trade. The government aims to implement the ban gradually through education and enforcement, pending Cabinet approval.

In our ten years covering the U.S. Vaping industry never has the future looked so bleak. Joining us today to unpack the mounting contradictions of Trump’s FDA is Lindsey Stroud, THR policy expert and founder of Tobacco Harm Reduction 101 at thr101.org.

The conversation highlights how headlines like “teen ER visits surge” can obscure distinctions between acute nicotine toxicity and far more subjective “e‑cigarette dependence” admissions that have driven much of the increase in reported cases. The discussion also explores how clinicians may mark visits as vape-related simply because a patient discloses vaping, even when it’s incidental to the medical issue, potentially inflating counts without reflecting actual vaping-caused harm.
