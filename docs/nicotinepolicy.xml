Brits could face five years in jail and a £320,000 fine. The crackdown has been criticized as disproportionate, with warnings that well-meaning tourists could unknowingly break the law. The ban, the strictest in Europe, aims to preserve public health but has sparked controversy. It may lead to a black market and affect athletes using pouches for performance enhancement. Despite concerns, French officials proceeded with the ban, leaving many questioning the logic of making carrying a pouch more dangerous than carrying heroin.
