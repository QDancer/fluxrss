They are focusing on the Juul2 platform with enhanced features and age verification checks to deter underage use. Despite criticism, Juul remains committed to harm reduction for adult smokers. The tobacco industry has historically faced hurdles in innovation due to regulatory and communication barriers, hindering harm reduction alternatives. This cycle of demonization has impeded progress in reducing harm from smoking. Restricting safer options while allowing conventional cigarettes to dominate perpetuates harm and limits consumer choice. The need for a shift towards harm reduction and policies supporting innovation is crucial in public health efforts.

The measure took effect on 1 November to safeguard public health and create a tobacco-free generation. The ban encompasses all tobacco products and applies to residents and visitors alike. Violators face fines, with retailers required to verify age before selling. The Maldives also prohibits e-cigarettes and vaping products. In comparison, the UK is still considering a similar ban, while New Zealand repealed theirs just under a year after its introduction in November 2023.

Dr. Glantz misrepresents the scientific evidence, as extensive clinical research shows that switching from smoking to vaping leads to significant health improvements, including better respiratory symptoms and lung function; millions of people have experienced these benefits, and while dual use offers fewer gains than complete switching, there is no credible evidence that it increases harm, making claims that e-cigarettes worsen health scientifically unfounded and irresponsible.

Daily vape use is popular among 25-49-year-olds and rising among women. The NHS states vaping poses fewer risks than smoking due to fewer harmful chemicals. Currently, 10% of UK adults use e-cigarettes, slightly more than smokers. Efforts to reduce smoking include bans on indoor smoking, smoking in cars with children, plain cigarette packaging, and future legislation prohibiting tobacco sales to those born after 2009.
