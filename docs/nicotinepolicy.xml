The World Health Organization battles misinformation but spreads inaccuracies about vaping, impacting public trust. False claims about vaping by the WHO and others perpetuate misconceptions, affecting policies globally. Despite victories and consumer-led movements advocating for tobacco harm reduction, challenges persist, including bans and regulations in various countries. Advocates continue efforts to safeguard access to safer nicotine products. Celebrating past successes, proponents aim to inspire progress and unity on World Vape Day and beyond in the ongoing fight for vaping rights and public health.

The Investigative Desk and The BMJ's investigation found that only 20% of leading medical journals have policies against tobacco-funded studies. Identifying funding sources is challenging due to tobacco companies' involvement in various fields. The revised BMJ policy now excludes research funded by the industry and work with authors' financial ties to tobacco companies, aiming to publish more independent and reliable content. Experts emphasize the importance of rejecting industry money to protect public health and integrity in research.

Mexico's smoking rate has increased, causing 65,000 deaths yearly, while Sweden's rate has dropped significantly. Legal, affordable access to alternatives like snus and vapes has aided Sweden's success. Bans in Mexico have led to a black market and failed to curtail smoking. The report advocates for harm reduction policies, emphasizing the safety of alternatives compared to cigarettes. It suggests that legalizing and regulating these products can help smokers transition away from harmful smoking. (Published on June 03, 2025byclearingtheair.eu)</description></item></channel></rss>
