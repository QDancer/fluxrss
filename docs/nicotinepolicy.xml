The Investigative Desk and The BMJ's investigation found that only 20% of leading medical journals have policies against tobacco-funded studies. Identifying funding sources is challenging due to tobacco companies' involvement in various fields. The revised BMJ policy now excludes research funded by the industry and work with authors' financial ties to tobacco companies, aiming to publish more independent and reliable content. Experts emphasize the importance of rejecting industry money to protect public health and integrity in research.

Only FDA-approved tobacco and mint e-cigarettes can be sold in convenience stores, with fruit and candy flavors restricted to specialty shops. Aimed at curbing youth vaping, the law impacts retailer revenue with fines for violations. The industry braces for financial strain, while health advocates support the move to protect youth from vaping risks.

Mexico's smoking rate has increased, causing 65,000 deaths yearly, while Sweden's rate has dropped significantly. Legal, affordable access to alternatives like snus and vapes has aided Sweden's success. Bans in Mexico have led to a black market and failed to curtail smoking. The report advocates for harm reduction policies, emphasizing the safety of alternatives compared to cigarettes. It suggests that legalizing and regulating these products can help smokers transition away from harmful smoking.
