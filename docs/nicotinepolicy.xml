Smart public health policy and a step toward autonomy behind bars</title><link>https://reason.org/commentary/prisons-selling-vapes-smart-public-health-policy-and-a-step-toward-autonomy-behind-bars/</link><description>The text discusses a proposal for American prisons to sell safer smoking alternatives to inmates, aiming to improve public health, reduce contraband markets, and cut healthcare costs. Prohibited tobacco has led to high smoking rates among prisoners, and bans have failed to eliminate it. By allowing nicotine vapes in commissaries, health benefits and reduced healthcare expenses may result, aiding smoking cessation post-release. Despite concerns, specially designed vapes could be safe. Pricing is key, as overly expensive products could perpetuate smoking. The proposal requires careful execution, offering affordable, quality choices to inmates. Advocates stress the importance of empowering incarcerated individuals and addressing their health needs.
