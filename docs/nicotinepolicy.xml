The law, which has passed the draft stage, aims to extend existing restrictions, crack down on new smoking devices, and prohibit tobacco advertising. Fines could reach €600,000 for serious violations, impacting not only smokers but also establishments failing to enforce the ban. Public consultation and further legislative steps are needed before the law can take effect, stirring debate on the impact of these measures.
