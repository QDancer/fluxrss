Recent adoption of harm reduction products like heated tobacco has led to significant reductions in cigarette consumption. The WHO's skepticism despite scientific evidence hinders progress. Illicit cigarette trade is growing due to bans on flavored HTPs. Hungary needs to consider the efficacy of harm reduction at COP11 to address the limitations of traditional anti-smoking policies.

Proposals hint at limiting nicotine levels and antagonizing flavors. Regulatory policies seek good intentions but may raise smoking rates and create black markets. U.S. regulations delay reduced-risk products, favoring large companies. Flavors aid smoking cessation, especially with adult smokers. Bans can boost cigarette sales and illicit markets, endangering public health. The focus should be on evidence-based regulations allowing flavored options for adult smokers while curbing youth access. The goal is to reduce smoking-related harm through pragmatic approaches.
