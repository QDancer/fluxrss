A study suggests complete nicotine cessation for pregnant individuals due to harmful substances in e-cigarettes. Up to 7% of women vape during pregnancy, increasing concerns despite some considering it safer than smoking. Research shows a 40% higher risk of preterm birth, 49% risk of low birth weight, and 32% risk of small-for-gestational-age babies with vaping. The study reviewed data from 9 studies involving 423,680 pregnant women. Advocates stress the need to educate on risks, support quitting, and regulate vaping marketing to protect maternal and fetal health.
