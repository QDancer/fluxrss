Combustible cigarettes pose significant health risks due to the toxic chemicals from combustion. Smoke-free options like vaping and heated tobacco offer lower risks, aiding in smoking cessation when properly regulated. Bans and high prices protect the cigarette market but harm public health. Governments like Vietnam and Bangladesh have enforced bans, while countries like New Zealand and Sweden have successfully reduced smoking through pragmatic regulations. Embracing harm reduction, rather than prohibition, can save lives in the Asia-Pacific region, where smoking-related deaths are high.
