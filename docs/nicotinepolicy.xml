The changes include higher taxes on cigarettes, fine-cut tobacco, cigars, cigarillos, heated tobacco, and e-liquids. Cigarette excise duty increased to €56.10 per 1,000 cigarettes, with other tobacco products also facing tax hikes. Notably, e-liquids used in electronic cigarettes will now be taxed at €0.20 per millilitre. These adjustments are projected to generate an extra €74.7 million for the state budget and have public health benefits.
