The US imposed a 60% tariff on Chinese vapes, prompting Chinese manufacturers to target the UK market. With the UK banning disposable vapes, concerns arise about the influx of Chinese alternatives. Industry experts warn of challenges in regulating these new products and ensuring they are not mistaken for disposables. Manufacturers are adapting by introducing rechargeable vape kits, but refill availability remains a concern. Amid environmental worries, efforts are needed to facilitate vape recycling.

The debate questions if these alternatives aid smoking cessation or create new nicotine users. Critiques reveal major flaws in prominent anti-vaping research, casting doubt on its credibility and impact on policy-making. Encouraging harm reduction, groups advocate for evidence-based regulation instead of moral panic. Success stories in countries like Sweden demonstrate reduced smoking rates through harm reduction strategies. Despite mounting evidence, some nations persist in restrictive regulations, risking progress in smoking cessation. It's time for public health leaders to embrace harm reduction and dismiss flawed research hindering societal health gains.
