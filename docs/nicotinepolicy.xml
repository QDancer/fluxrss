These products, disguised as everyday items, can deliver harmful doses of nicotine and toxic chemicals. Governments must step in to regulate or ban e-cigarettes to protect young people. Several countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region have already taken action. The WHO is calling for strong measures to prevent a new epidemic of addiction and disease.
