Nicotine benefits neurodivergent individuals, like those with ADHD, schizophrenia, and autism. Studies show nicotine can enhance cognitive function and mood. Nicotine aids in managing symptoms of ADHD and schizophrenia. THR products help decrease smoking rates among vulnerable populations like those with substance use disorders. Public health bodies acknowledge the reduced harm of products like vapes. Misinformation persists despite evidence of nicotine's therapeutic effects. Advocating for THR and supporting access to these products is crucial. It's time to reevaluate nicotine, promote harm reduction, and aid those who benefit from its cognitive and therapeutic properties.
