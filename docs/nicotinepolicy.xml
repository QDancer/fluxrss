Researchers at the University of Catania found significant increases in aerobic capacity among participants who made the switch, regardless of using e-cigarettes or heated tobacco products. These gains in fitness can motivate younger individuals to opt for safer nicotine alternatives. The study highlights the potential of smoke-free products as effective harm reduction tools, with improvements in cardiovascular efficiency seen as early as four weeks after quitting smoking. The findings suggest that both e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products can enhance cardiovascular fitness post-smoking cessation.

The research, using an EVSA assay on mice, found vanilla and benzaldehyde triggered reward-seeking responses. Even without nicotine, vanilla flavor alone led to addictive behavior. These flavored additives may affect the brain's dopamine system, potentially causing addiction-like behaviors in teens. The study highlights the impact of flavorings on nicotinic receptors, key in nicotine addiction. Lead investigator Henderson warns of the risks of flavored vapes marketed as nicotine-free.

The FDA emphasized that non-smokers should avoid e-cigarettes. Juul faced lawsuits over teen vaping but argued for their product's safety.

Using nicotine patches at the time, he began experimenting with vaporizing nicotine using food additives as solvents. In 2000, he developed the concept of using a piezoelectric ultrasound element to vaporize a nicotine-propylene glycol solution, stored in a disposable plastic cartridge. After refining the device into a handheld size, he patented it in China, and the first e-cigarette was manufactured in Beijing. His innovations laid the foundation for modern e-cigarettes. Honâ€™s story was presented at the 12th Global Forum on Nicotine (GFN 2025) in Warsaw, where he has supported the forum since 2015, promoting tobacco harm reduction.
