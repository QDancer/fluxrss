While lifestyle factors like smoking and BMI impact IVF success rates, the effects of vaping are less clear. Publicly-funded IVF faces funding limitations, leading to restrictions based on proven impacts. However, research on vaping's independent effects is inconclusive. Restrictions targeting vapers may be unjustified, as switching from smoking to vaping can improve fertility. The proposal aims to save money but could unfairly penalize vapers. A call for evidence-based policies is essential to ensure equitable access to IVF treatment. It remains crucial for the NHS to prioritize fair and evidence-based healthcare decisions.

The Ministry of Industry authorized their sale under strict regulations to reduce health risks. Although pouches decrease respiratory issues linked to smoking, they can impact cardiovascular health. While helpful in transitioning from cigarettes, doctors advise they are not a complete solution and stress the importance of proper usage and monitoring. Concerns include potential appeal to youth and lack of long-term safety studies. Regulations aim to ensure quality and safety, emphasizing the need for structured quitting plans. The effectiveness of nicotine pouches in reducing smoking prevalence in the UAE remains to be seen.

The Secretariat requested over $8.5 million to cover 19 staff for two years, seeking an 8% pay rise. The lowest-paid earns $96,930, well above global averages. Concerns were raised about prioritizing staff salaries over supporting Low and Medium Income Countries. Contributions from the UK, EU, and others mainly cover staff costs. Critics argue that funds could be used more efficiently. The FCTC Secretariat's high salaries are criticized as prioritizing self-interest over public health.

They warn of irreversible harm caused by exposure to toxins and carcinogens, including unknown risks. Nicotine in e-cigarettes poses addiction and brain development hazards for adolescents, leading to cardiovascular issues. Studies show vaping increases stroke risk and releases harmful chemicals impacting the heart. Experts fear vaping may become a gateway to smoking and stress the urgent need for regulations to protect young people. Long-term effects are still unknown, but a ban on e-cigarette sales is suggested to prevent harm based on existing data and concerns.

Despite this, he is correct about the safety of nicotine pouches, supported by Health Canada. Canada's restrictions on pouch sales are deemed counterproductive and hypocritical compared to Sweden's successful use. Embracing pouches as a cessation tool, as seen in Sweden, could significantly reduce smoking rates and related illnesses in Canada. The focus should shift to harm reduction and adopting successful strategies from other countries.

Vaping was created for safer nicotine enjoyment. Prohibitionists ignore vaping's origins, pushing abstinence and overlooking harmlessness. John Stuart Mill's harm principle supports individual choice, not authoritarianism like in Singapore. Prohibitionists' stance threatens personal freedoms and safer alternatives, aiming to infantilize adults and limit pleasure. Vaping is about enjoyment, not just quitting smoking. Prohibitionists' views could be more dangerous than vaping itself. The focus should be on individual choice and harm reduction, not imposing moral judgements.

By adopting strict policies, harm reduction strategies, and promoting reduced-risk products, Pakistan can work towards reducing its tobacco-related deaths. Sweden's success in lowering smoking rates through evidence-based policies and harm reduction serves as a model for other countries. Pakistan faces challenges in enforcing tobacco control laws and lacks research on harm reduction products. Emulating Sweden's comprehensive approach and promoting public awareness can help Pakistan move towards a smoke-free future. Dr. Islam emphasizes the importance of determination and effective policymaking in combating the tobacco epidemic. (Published on September 02, 2025by2firsts.com)</description></item></channel></rss>
