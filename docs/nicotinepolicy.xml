In this GFN News interview, Will Godfrey of Filter examines the claims that all forms of nicotine pose equal cardiovascular risk and the strong backlash from independent experts. The discussion explores criticisms of the report’s scientific approach, evidence from population studies, and concerns that its conclusions could influence upcoming EU tobacco, taxation, and health policies. With Europe already facing the world’s highest smoking rates, the video asks whether this narrative could undermine harm reduction efforts and discourage smokers from switching to less harmful alternatives.

Richmond's successful Stop Smoking Service, offering free vape kits and assistance, has helped over 178 residents quit smoking in a year. This approach is supported by evidence of vaping being less harmful than cigarettes and an effective quitting aid.
