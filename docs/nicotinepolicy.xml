Brits could face five years in jail and a £320,000 fine. The crackdown has been criticized as disproportionate, with warnings that well-meaning tourists could unknowingly break the law. The ban, the strictest in Europe, aims to preserve public health but has sparked controversy. It may lead to a black market and affect athletes using pouches for performance enhancement. Despite concerns, French officials proceeded with the ban, leaving many questioning the logic of making carrying a pouch more dangerous than carrying heroin.

Officials like Commissioner Hoekstra falsely equate vaping with smoking, ignoring evidence and discouraging smokers from switching. The WHO director mistakenly claims all tobacco is equally harmful, disregarding vaping's safer profile. This misinformation leads to more deaths and disease by deterring smokers from switching to less harmful alternatives. The upcoming EU directive reviews offer a chance to correct this harmful trend with evidence-based regulation. As World Vape Day nears, contrasting celebrations highlight vaping's success in helping millions quit smoking. It's crucial for the EU Commission and WHO to prioritize public health over ideology and end their harmful stance on harm reduction.

The plan faces opposition from countries with lower tax rates and those investing in innovative tobacco. Italy warns against hindering innovation, as sharp tax hikes could increase smuggling. Concerns are raised over proposed high taxes on new tobacco products lacking EU regulation. The push for a unified EU policy on alternative tobacco products is suggested to address rising smuggling issues. Drastic tax hikes may not be suitable now, as they could strain resources and enforcement without substantial benefits.
