The agency stated that Juul's research shows these products are less harmful for adult smokers who switch completely from traditional cigarettes. This decision follows years of controversy, with Juul being widely blamed for contributing to the rise in teen vaping. The ruling applies only to the tobacco and menthol versions, as Juul had already pulled its fruit and candy flavors from the market due to their appeal to teens.
