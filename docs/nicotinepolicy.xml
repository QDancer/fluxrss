The system is unsustainable, favoring quantity over quality in publications and research that aligns with funding agency priorities. Pressure to secure NIH grants leads researchers to conform to agency views, hindering unbiased research. The oversaturation of PhDs exacerbates competition for academic positions, perpetuating a cycle of grant dependence. The focus on grant funding also compromises teaching quality and hampers diverse research perspectives. Future posts will explore solutions to address these systemic challenges in academia.

The research cited lacks evidence of causation, purposefully excludes benefits, and relies on low-quality data. The umbrella review of reviews on youth vaping connected it to smoking and health issues but didn't prove causation. Claims of vaping leading to smoking were disputed, with smoking rates among youth decreasing as vaping rose. Concerns about asthma effects were uncertain. The EVALI outbreak was linked to illicit THC, not nicotine e-liquids. Experts suggest caution with youth vaping while avoiding broad conclusions about adult harm reduction based on this limited review. Media misrepresentation undermines harm reduction efforts.

The government currently refrains from banning vapes and e-cigarettes to avoid complications after legally registering and regulating the industry under Act 852. Dzulkefly noted that a sudden ban could lead to legal issues due to the expectation set by the existing regulations. While considering a complete ban, factors like legal implications, enforcement, and public health are being evaluated. Some states have already prohibited vape sales.

Suffering from an illness, she failed a sobriety test and faced multiple charges including intent to sell drugs. Police seized her lab equipment, medications, and mocked her during the arrest. Despite paying bail, her community work was hindered by increased police surveillance. The case highlights legal uncertainties around harm reduction practices. Lemen aims to prove her innocence in court but fears the outcome's impact on future drug checking cases. She stresses the importance of understanding and supporting harm reduction efforts.

They also felt more aware of their behaviors and found the intervention useful. The researchers suggest that Smart-T could be a cost-effective tool to help reduce smoking-related health disparities. The study, led by Emily T. Hébert, was published in JAMA Network Open. Limitations included the need for a specific quit date and Smart-T's availability only on Android devices.

Trends show most youth start with e-cigarettes, not to quit smoking. Nicotine pouch use is rising, with Zyn being popular among youth. Nicotine impacts young brains differently, making them more vulnerable to addiction. The tobacco industry targets young people, knowing they're more likely to get addicted. Teaching kids to see through industry manipulation is vital. Education, not shaming, is key in tobacco prevention. Parents must be aware and listen to kids using nicotine for stress. Understanding the risks and effects of nicotine is crucial for youth health and prevention efforts.

The plan includes minimum taxes of 40-55% on vaping e-liquids, nicotine pouches, and heated tobacco products, which critics argue will hinder efforts to reduce smoking rates. Some EU member states, including Portugal, have raised objections to the tax proposal, stating that taxing less harmful smoking alternatives may discourage smokers from switching. Unanimous agreement from all 27 EU nations is needed for the proposal to become law. Critics emphasize the importance of promoting safer nicotine products to achieve the EU's smoke-free goal and warn against the potential negative impact of the tax plan.

The measure removed them from convenience stores nationwide in Canada and restricted permitted flavours in pharmacies to only mint and menthol.
